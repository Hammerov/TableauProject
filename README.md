This is a complete data analytics and exploration project of the London bike sharing data. It utilizes Python for data manipulation and cleaning
and Tableau for data visualization.We extract the file from its zip with Python and use pandas library to explore, assess and manipulate this data after which
we write out the final data set to an Excel file called London bikes final.Using our final dataset we visualize everything in Tableau creating 5 visualizations.
